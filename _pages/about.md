<!-- ## About Me -->
I am a third-year Master's student at Fudan University, advised by Prof. [Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io/). I am currently researching the trustworthiness of large language models under the supervision of Prof. [Pengfei Liu](https://plms.ai/people/index.html), and I am grateful for the opportunity to work with Prof. [Graham Neubig](https://www.phontron.com/). Before joining Fudan, I received my bachelor's degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2021.

My current research interests focus on the trustworthiness of large language models, particularly on hallucination and honesty. I previously worked in the area of Information Extratcion.
