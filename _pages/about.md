<!-- ## About Me -->
I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Fudan University, advised by Prof. [Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io/). 
Currently, I am also interning at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/).

My research interests lie in the field of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, with a particular focus on large language models and methods to enhance their efficiency and efficacy.
